								The crew of the ill-fated Il-86 also used a new technique and released the flaps to the landing
								gear. Unaware of the new trends in piloting, the Il-86 automatics immediately turned on the
								voice and light alarms, which required the crew to release the landing gear. So that the alarm
								system did not annoy the pilots, it was simply turned off, as one turns off a sleepy alarm
								clock. Now there was no one to remind the crew that the landing gear still needed to be
								released. Today, however, there are already copies of Tu-154 and Il-86 aircraft with modified
								alarms, which fly according to the approach method with a late release of mechanization.

								Course and glide system <br>
								The course and glide path system consists of two parts: pairs of directional and glide path
								beacons. Two directional beacons are located behind the runway and emit a directional radio
								signal along it at different frequencies at small angles. On the runway centerline, the
								intensity of both signals is the same. To the left and right of this line, the signal from one
								of the beacons is stronger than the other. By comparing the intensity of the signals, the
								aircraft's radio navigation system determines which side and how far it is from the centerline.
								Two glide path beacons are located in the area of the landing zone and operate in the same way,
								only in the vertical plane.

								To begin with, let's make terminological clarity. A hard landing in aviation use is a landing
								with an overload that is much higher than the standard one. As a result of such a landing, the
								aircraft in the worst case receives damage in the form of residual deformation, and in the best
								case â€” requires special maintenance aimed at additional monitoring of the aircraft's condition.
								As Igor Kulik, a leading flight instructor at the S7 Airlines Flight Standards Department,
								explained to us, today a pilot who made a real hard landing is suspended from flying and sent
								for additional training on simulators. Before getting back on the flight, the offender will also
								have a test and training flight with an instructor.
